## Assignment 4 - Modified CYK

### Tasks
1. Determine if given strings are generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form
2. Compute rightmost-derivations of a given string that is generated by the grammar
3. Determine if given strings are ambiguous

### Input/Output Formats
See tests folder for examples.

#### CFG in CNF
1. variable symbols (comma separated list)
2. terminal symbols (comma separated list)
3. start variable
4. 1+ lines of the form:
  * A -> B C
  * A -> a
  * A -> epsilon
5. the string **end**

#### Membership
Input: sequence of lines containing the string **membership**, the CFG in CNF, several strings to check, the string **end** <br>
Output: 1 or 0 for each input string

#### Rightmost-derivation
Input: sequence of lines containing the string **rightmost-derivation**, the CFG in CNF, one string to derive, the string **end** <br>
Output: sequence of lines representing a rightmost derivation, the string **end**

#### Ambiguous
Input: sequence of lines containing the string **ambiguous**, the CFG in CNF,  several strings to check, the string **end** <br>
Output: 1 or 0 for each input string
