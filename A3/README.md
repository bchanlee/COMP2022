## Assignment 3 - NFA to DFA

### Tasks
1. Compute epsilon closures of NFA
2. Construct epsilon-free NFA from NFA
3. Construct DFA from epsilon-free NFA
4. Decide if given strings are in the language 

### Input/Output Formats
See tests folder for examples.

#### NFA/DFA
1. set of states (comma separated list)
2. set of alphabet symbols (comma separated list)
3. start state
4. set of final states (comma separated list)
5. sequence of lines representing transitions (comma separated list of three values **s,c,t** denoting a transition from **s** to **t** on symbol **c**.
6. the word **end** on a line by itself

#### Epsilon Closures
Colon separated list

#### Strings to test
Input: One string per line <br>
Output: 1 or 0 on each line
